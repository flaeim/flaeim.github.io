Scaffolding is an auxiliary structure that is used when performing installation and finishing work at height. It is a rigid frame made of various assembly modules, following the contours of the building.

## General guidelines for scaffolding safety

With minor exceptions, only scaffolding made according to standard designs and having a manufacturer's certificate is allowed for operation. The certificate indicates material, allowable load limit, and assembly features.

The scaffolding can be made from the following materials:

1. Wood, dry and coated with an antiseptic. Only elastic softwoods are used.
2. Metal box-shaped beams or circular hollow sections — they are primed and painted before assembly.

Additional processing of the material is to minimize the negative impact of moisture on scaffolding.

An important point of safety is to install scaffolding correctly. The qualified employees or a third-party company that has the appropriate certificates should do that. When installing scaffolding, it is important to consider the sequence of work. The structure must be stable and securely fastened vertically and horizontally. Be sure to have railings, canopies, solid flooring and stairs. For scaffolds over 6 m, additional decks are installed to protect workplaces on top.

## Scaffolding safety measures

To ensure the safe operation of scaffolding, the following measures are taken:

1. Fences are installed in places of vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
2. Before starting work, all employees must undergo a safety briefing, and scaffolding must be tested for strength.
3. Structural reliability is repeatedly tested every 10 days.
4. The information on the permissible loads, schemes for the safe movement and placement of goods are placed next to the stairs.
5. All work on scaffolding is stopped when it gets dark and under adverse weather conditions (thunderstorms, wind gusts over 8-10 m/s).
6. It is forbidden to work on scaffolding located closer than 5 m from power lines.

It is important to communicate to employees that they can transfer materials, tools and move along scaffolds only by the specified routes. The same applies to safe descent and ascent — it is allowed using the ladders provided on the inside of the sections.

## Scaffolding occupational health

To ensure the safety of employees working on scaffolding, it is necessary to:

1. Monitor the condition of the decking, if necessary, clean it from dirt, and treat it with anti-icing agents.
2. Check aisles for cluttering with tools and materials.
3. Provide additional overlap between standards to prevent accidents.
4. Remove materials and debris at the end of work to prevent exceeding the permissible load.

Only employees who have undergone special instructions and have received a work permit are allowed to work at a height of 5 m or more. In the case of the simultaneous work of several teams at different heights, the presence of additional protective decks is mandatory.

## Scaffolding electrical safety

Scaffolding made of metal beams needs to be grounded. The foundation of the structure under construction is used as a ground electrode if it is reinforced concrete. In the same way, you can use a metal container or pipe dug into the ground. The main thing is that their resistance does not exceed 15 ohms. Another mandatory feature for electrical safety is the lightning rods. Usually, they are made in the form of pipes with a diameter of 60 mm, flattened at one end and welded to scaffolding posts at a distance of 20 m from each other.

When all safety regulations are followed, scaffolding is a stable and safe structure for both workers and residents of nearby areas. Violation of these precautions leads to financial damage or even accidents. Therefore, monitoring their implementation is an important task for every manager.
