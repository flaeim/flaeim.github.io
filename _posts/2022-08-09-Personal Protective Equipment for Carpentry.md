### Eye protection

Safety glasses with plastic or metal built and with impact resistance with side protection are required. Chemical splash glasses protect from dust, impact, and splashes. Dust goggles with a tight fit to avoid entry of large or small particles into the eyes. Face shield from eyebrows to lower chin is to prevent harmful sprays, splashes, and liquids. It should be UV resistant. Laser protective wear for eyes to avoid radiation may be needed. Welding protection eyewear made of fiberglass or vulcanized rubbed shields eye burn due to IR or radiant light or sparks.
