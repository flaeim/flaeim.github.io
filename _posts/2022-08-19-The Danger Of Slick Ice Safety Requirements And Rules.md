Warm winter, sudden temperature swings or a spring drop with night frosts are almost always accompanied by black ice or regular slick ice. The difference between these phenomena lies only in the density of the ice formed on the pavement, the ground or the road.

Regular ice is a denser layer that affects wires and tree branches. The thickness of the crust can be several centimeters. The temperature at which it forms is from 0 °C to -3 °C.

We will consider in this article how pedestrians and drivers should behave in icy conditions, as well as how to fall correctly so as not to get injured.

## Tips for pedestrians

If the temperature outside suggests the presence of ice, then before going outside, you should choose the right shoes. Winter or spring-autumn shoes should have non-slip soles. So, when buying, pay attention to the height, depth and shape of the tread patterns. The material is also important here. Polyurethane and thermoplastic polyurethane are considered the most non-slippery.

### The following tricks will help ensure the safety of pedestrians on slick ice:
1. There are special anti-icing pads for shoes. You can pick any type you like.
2. You can stick adhesive bandage or tape on shoes, or just rub the sole with sandpaper.
3. Stick foam pads to heels — the optimal height for winter is considered to be no more than 5 cm.

Avoid ice, if possible, otherwise, move around the icy area with extreme caution and attention. Don't rush, don't speed up, and don't run. Hands should not be in pockets, step on the ice with the whole sole.

Elderly people or those who, due to a medical condition, are forced to use a cane should also prepare it for icy roads. A cane in winter should have a rubber tip or pointed spikes. Ice safety can be provided by a usual ski pole.

Pay special attention to electrical wires that can break due to icing. Do not walk near residential buildings, as there is a high probability of icicles or ice falling from the roof.
Remember that the most dangerous places are icy steps and porches. Hold on to the railing, free your hands from the weights and carefully pass these areas. Try to get out of the house in a good time.

## Basic driving rules
In winter or off-season time, the safety of drivers in icy conditions depends not only on driving style but also on the condition and state of the car itself.

Pay special attention to studded winter tires. It is better to choose a small, but a rather rich pattern. Make sure the "wipers" and the headlights work. Use non-freezing washer liquid.

Keep in mind that ice often occurs at public transport stops, overpasses, bridges or on suburban highways.

### Thanks to some indications it is possible to predict the appearance of an icy area and prepare for it:

Ice requires low air temperature. If the cabin windows are fogged up, then, most likely, it has become colder outside, and, possibly, there will be black ice ahead.

The change in tread noise and the feeling that the car is not moving, but “floating” also indicates that you are on an icy part of the road.

### Safety on the icy road depends on how correctly and calmly you will react. There are the following recommendations for drivers:

1. Do not suddenly brake and release the gas pedal. Clutch disengagement is also prohibited. These actions will only lead to the fact that your car will slide off the road.
2. Do not let go of the steering wheel, but do not turn it sharply in different directions.
3. When driving up the hill, increase your speed slightly so that you do not have to change gear in the process.
4. Be sure to keep your distance
5. Do not perform abrupt maneuvers while overtaking
6. In an emergency, the handbrake can help out.

Remember that the winter road is not a place for recklessness, conflicts and finding out who has the coolest car. Courteous interaction between drivers is at the heart of safe driving.

## Learning to fall properly

The safety of pedestrians on ice also depends on the ability to fall safely. Falls on ice are associated with bruises of varying severity, dislocations and fractures. The most dangerous are injuries to the head and spine.

To cushion the fall at the moment when you slipped, you should bend your knees as you are going to sit. This will reduce the drop height. Muscles should be tensed, so you protect the bones from impact. It is risky to put your hands out in the hope of preventing a fall, and also to fall full-force on your back and buttocks.

A common injury during a period of ice is a fracture of the femoral neck. The recovery takes a long time and is especially hard for the elderly. Better to fall keeping your arms and legs bent. The best option would be to roll or fall on your side.

Falling on your back, protect your head with your hands, while bending your arms at the elbows and pressing them to the body.

Don't get up too fast. First, make sure that you have not gotten serious injuries. Seek help from passers-by if you can't get up on your own.

If you fell in an area with no people around, then first get on all fours and only then slowly rise. It is better if you find some object to lean on.

### How to help an injured person
The least dangerous are bruises on soft tissues. It is easy to recognize them by the formation of swelling at the impact areas, change in the skin color and painful sensations. An important difference between a hematoma and dislocation or sprain is movement restrictions.

If you suspect a dislocation, do not try to fix it yourself. Also, do not massage the damaged area, disturb it, apply a warm compress or smear it with ointment. If you are unable to help the sufferer or are seriously injured yourself, immediately call an ambulance — you can find out how to do it quickly and correctly in our How To Call An Ambulance article.

If it is cold outside, then you should take the sufferer to a warm place while waiting for the ambulance. Otherwise, in addition to injury, the person risks getting hypothermia. Remember that if the spine is damaged, you can not touch the person — it is forbidden to shake, carry, and lift him into a sitting position.
