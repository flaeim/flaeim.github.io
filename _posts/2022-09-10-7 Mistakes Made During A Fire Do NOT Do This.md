A person can behave unpredictably in a stressful situation, make rush and dangerous actions. The same thing is true for behavior during a fire when adults completely forget what they told their own children.

Therefore, you need to clearly remember what you cannot do if a fire occurs. Let's talk about all the details here.

## Panic

Of course, in a stressful situation, it is very difficult to remain calm, but it is extremely necessary. By keeping your head cool, you have every chance to save yourself and your loved ones.

If people around you panic, try to remain calm and soothe those around you.

You need to say loud and clear that you know what needs to be done. Even if you don't have any plan of action, it will help calm people down a bit and give time to take some action.

If a fire suddenly breaks out, remember the rules of conduct that you told your children, and do not make stupid mistakes that could cost you your life.

## Don't call the fire station

The first rule in case of fire is to immediately call the firefighters (rescuers). Many people put off calling for an emergency, trying to put out the fire on their own first.

But this is a mistake since it is difficult to predict how fast the fire will spread, and the loss of time before the information is out will affect the conditions for response and rescue of the victims.

If you smell smoke, or heat, or see pinpoints of flame, immediately inform the rescuers by calling 911 or 112, leaving the dangerous place at the same time.

Most people now have means of communication — salvation depends on the time the message arrives.

## Open windows and doors wide open

It would seem that getting rid of smoke during a fire is simple: just open a door or window wide open. Just never do it at all!

<ins>An important note:</ins> unlock the door to the apartment, but do not open it. This will make it easier for rescuers to get inside and evacuate.

If the fire is indoors, then a large amount of oxygen will inflow, because of which the fire will only flare up more strongly. The same goes for breaking windows — don't do it if it won't let you get out.

The smoke rises up the ventilation to the upper floors. Open windows in apartments create an additional draft, as a result, more smoke enters the room, and people just suffocate.

__Open the window in the kitchen and, if possible, close the ventilation to make it difficult for smoke to enter from there.__ The smoke that got into the apartment will go out through the window.

If you managed to get into the room adjacent to the fire area, then close the door tightly and carefully seal all the cracks and holes with wet rags. This way you block smoke from entering the room as much as possible. After that, you can try to open or break a window in this room to call for help (on top of that use a white cloth or a flashlight to mark your location).

__Important:__ as the case may be, choose the adjacent room so that it is possible for you to escape from it, or to make yourself visible there (there should be windows, flights of stairs, etc.).

The combustion products rise up and leave an air area below, so you need to lie on the floor and cover your face with a wet towel (if possible). Water in this case will act as an air filter.

## Run out into a smoky hallway

Do not try to get out of the apartment through a smoky hallway or staircase, especially if you live on the upper floors. One breath of combustion products is enough to make a person lose consciousness — keep in mind that carbon monoxide has no color and smell.

It is best to have individual filtering devices with a mask at home, the so-called “escape hoods”. They are put on the head and within 15-30 minutes (depending on the model) protect from combustion products.

This is enough to, putting them on for yourself and your loved ones, calmly evacuate along the staircase.

But it is important to understand that most models of such escape hoods do __NOT saturate the inhaled air with oxygen.__ Escape hoods are used for fast evacuation from smoky premises.

It is prohibited to extinguish fire wearing them.

## Use the elevator

Keep in mind: in case of fire in the hallway or at other facilities where there is an elevator, it is strictly forbidden to use the elevator. Anything can happen, from the elevator stopping between floors to the fast filling of the shaft and the elevator cabin itself with combustion products.

The elevator shaft is, in fact, a pipe through which open fire and toxic smoke fumes can quickly spread to all floors of a construction facility.

## Save things
As expensive as the painting you have in your bedroom is, it's not worth risking your life in a fire. Do not try to save some things and jewelry, this is how you endanger your life and the lives of your loved ones.

When the fire starts, you only need to take documents with you, and only in case the fire is in a different place and there is no heavy smoke.

## Act like a movie character

Many movies are full of scenes where the main character enters a burning house or apartment, jumps out of a floor window during a fire and remains unharmed, or ties a rope out of sheets, and uses it for descending.

In real life, it is life-threatening. Keep in mind that the actions of the characters in the movie are the result of editing and the work of professional stuntmen, and not a guide to action.

## Tips for surviving a house fire
Remember: a balcony is not always able to save during a fire — you can get combustion product poisoning even while standing on the balcony. But if the house has outdoor fire escape stairs, you can use them.

In some houses there are fire escape stairs between balconies, which you also can take to evacuate; very often the fire escapes to these stairs from the balconies are littered or people do not even know about this way to escape.

If you live in high-rise buildings, you should carefully inspect your house and understand how to act in case of a fire and how to evacuate from the floors, for example, get out on the fire escape, if there is one.

It is a good idea to purchase autonomous smoke alarms that are attached to the ceiling and will give a signal in advance in case of smoke. If the fire occurred at night, you will wake up and take all the necessary actions.
