In today's article we will review the road safety briefings for drivers. What it is, when it is held and how it should be organized.

This briefing is one of the forms of road safety training for drivers, which should be carried out regularly in the organization.


## Types of briefings

Road safety training can be divided into the following types:

1.	Induction briefing
2.	Periodic briefing
3.	Seasonal briefing
4.	Special briefing


## General provisions for instructing drivers

Road safety briefings are provided to all drivers.

Instruction is carried out according to a specially developed training program. This program is developed based on the vehicles used, the cargo carried, working conditions, etc.

The instruction is to be carried out by a specially educated and trained person.

Next, we will analyse each of the instructions in a little more detail.

## 1.	Induction training

This briefing is carried out for all drivers hired (regardless of their experience and skill level)

## 2. Periodic briefing

This type of briefing is carried out with all drivers of vehicles within the time frame established by the briefing schedule.

### The content of the periodic briefing
  
The main purpose of this briefing is to remind the driver of the basic safety requirements at work, so the approximate content of the periodic road safety briefing will be as follows:

1.	Possible dangers and risks in the operation of vehicles.
2.	Basic safety rules when driving, stopping, repairing, etc.
3.	Implementation of anti-theft and fire prevention measures.
4.	Rules for the passage of railway crossings and overpasses

7.	Rules for first aid in a traffic accident.


## 3. Seasonal briefing

This type of briefing is carried out with all drivers of vehicles before starting of the:

2.	Autumn-winter season

## The content of the seasonal briefing

The approximate content of a seasonal road safety briefing is as follows:

Features of the operation of vehicles in certain road and weather conditions (ice, slippery roads, snowfall, river floods, etc.)

Usually, this type of briefing is combined with a repeated briefing, which is carried out just before the start of the autumn-winter (spring-summer) season.


## 4. Special briefing

Special briefings on road safety are carried out based on orders or orders from the management of the organization. Usually, they are carried out in the following cases:

1.	Entry into force of new or amendment of old laws.
2.	Change in traffic conditions on the route (the appearance of dangerous sections, a sudden change in weather conditions).
3.	Obtaining information about road accidents with human casualties or large material damage.
4.	When drivers commit accidents with human casualties.


## Content of the special briefing

The content of a special road safety briefing depends on the reason for it. For example:

1.	If there is a change in laws, then the attention of drivers is drawn to these changes.
2.	If there is a change in traffic conditions on the route, then the attention of drivers is drawn to these changes.
