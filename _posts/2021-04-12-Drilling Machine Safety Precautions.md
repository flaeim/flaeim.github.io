Make sure your workspace does not have any slippery hazards on the floor. If there is any slip contact, you might slip and fall on any of these machines, and that can be disastrous.

Make sure you correct every clamp and ensure that the rules are adhere correctly in the shop.

Make sure you create a safe path away from the work area.

Ensure the drill speed of the cutter is well spindled to suit it well.

Do not leave the-drill press on while it is still being used, never do that.

Anything you going to clean the place or the machines, make sure you switch off the machines before you start cleaning. Never assume the machines are off before you start cleaning. If you are not sure, please check well. 

Always make sure you feed the drill cutting machine at the downwards rate, to ensure you are safe and avoid any accident. 

Make sure the drill works through the underside, to ensure that the drill is working accurately and well.
