Safe chainsaw operation complies with the rules, which are conditionally divided into the following groups\:

1. Health monitoring.
2. Personal protective equipment usage.
3. Fire safety.
4. Check for satisfactory operation and starting of the chainsaw.
5. The position of the operator's body when sawing in different conditions.

Let's take a closer look at each item.

## HEALTH REQUIREMENTS

A chainsaw is a tool that requires constant and complete attention and concentration during work. The state of health and well-being of the operator should not prevent the full control of the sawing process and be the reason for slowing down the reaction or weakening of physical strength. Otherwise, in the event of an emergency, there is a risk of failing to handle the chainsaw, which can result in serious injuries.

### It is forbidden to use a chainsaw:

When you are tired from other physical work or due to other factors (lack of sleep, illness, etc.)
When you are under alcohol or drugs influence.
For people taking drugs that slow down the reaction or impair physical strength.
For visually impaired people.
When you are in a bad mood or annoyed.
If, due to age or general health, strenuous and physically demanding work quickly tires you. Consult a doctor before using a chainsaw.

## PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

The following personal protective equipment must be worn whenever the chainsaw is used:

Goggles or face mask — to protect the eyes from flying sawdust, dust, and branches.
Earplugs or noise-canceling headphones — for hearing protection.
A helmet — to protect the head from falling branches and other objects.
Rough gloves with anti-slip coating — to protect hands and to help securely hold the chainsaw.
Safety shoes with a metal toe caps — to protect the feet from the saw chain injuries.

It is recommended to use special trousers, overalls or cut-protection pads.

### When working with a chainsaw, do not use:

1. cotton wool to protect the hearing organs;
2. tinted sunglasses designed to protect from the sun;
3. headphones for listening to music;
4. loose, unfastened clothing;
5. scarves, ties, jewelry, and anything that can be caught by the saw chain.

## FIRE SAFETY RULES

The chainsaw runs on a mixture of gasoline and oil, which is flammable. Careless handling of fuel can result in severe thermal burns, food poisoning, and loss of property.

When preparing the fuel mixture and refueling the chainsaw, observe the following rules:

1. To mix gasoline with oil, use a specially designed container.
2. When opening the fuel tank cap, be aware that it may be pressurized. First, loosen the cap a little, and only after the air drains, continue to unscrew all the way through.
3. Fuel your chainsaw outdoors, away from open flames.
4. Use a fuel can with the appropriate spout size.
5. Visually control the fill level of the fuel tank — avoid overfilling.
6. If fuel does get on the surface of the tool, wipe it thoroughly with a dry cloth.
7. After work is done, drain the remaining fuel mixture.

### When handling chainsaw fuel, it is prohibited to:

1. use canisters, plastic bottles and other containers unintended for gasoline;
2. freely pour the fuel mixture into the tank without a funnel;
3. smoke;
3. fuel the tool on the warmed-up engine;
5. be indoors.

## CHECK FOR SATISFACTORY OPERATION AND STARTING OF THE CHAINSAW

Before each start of the chainsaw engine:

1. Move the tool at least 3 meters away from the place where you have prepared the 2.fuel mixture and filled the fuel tank.
2. Make sure there are no people or animals nearby.
3. Remove the protective cover from the bar.
4. Make sure that the saw chain does not touch the ground, grass or other objects.
5. Check if the chain tension is correct and, if necessary, adjust it accordingly.

### It is forbidden to use a chainsaw if:

1. the chain is not sharpened, damaged or ultimately worn;
2. the bar is bent, twisted, the groove of the bar is worn out;
3. the chain brake is broken, missing or non-functioning;
4. chainsaw bears the mechanical damage marks;
5. some factory-installed component parts are missing.

The chainsaw is started according to the following algorithm:

1. If possible, install the chainsaw on a level surface, free from foreign objects.
2. Set the chain brake to the locked position.
3. Turn on the ignition.
4. Close the choke.
5. Hold the chainsaw firmly with your hand.
6. Additionally, you can hold the saw with your foot by stepping on the platform under the handle.
7. Pull the starter handle several times until the engine starts.
8. Open the choke.
9. Start the engine.
10. Warm-up a cold engine for a minute.
11. A warmed-up chainsaw engine starts in the same way, but steps 4, 7 and 8 are skipped.

## OPERATOR'S POSITION

The work performed by a chainsaw can be organized in the following main types:

1. tree felling;
2. cutting branches;
3. trunks cross-cutting and sawing lumber.

Depending on this, the operator adopts the appropriate body position, as well as applies the sawing techniques described in the manual.

Observe the following rules when using a chainsaw:

1. always take the most stable posture;
2. hold the chainsaw with both hands, clasping the handles with all fingers;
3. don't saw above your chest;
4. do not cut branches that you are leaning on or that are under load;
5. do not stand on the log being cut when crosscutting or sawing firewood;
6. small trunks to be sawn must be secured;
7. do not cut the log by holding it with your foot next to the running chain.
