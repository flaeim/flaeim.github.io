Forklifts, stackers, carts — these are all serious industrial equipment that must be handled properly, observing safety precautions. An irresponsible attitude can lead not only to damage to the cargo or equipment but also to a life threat to both the forklift operator and warehouse workers. To prevent this, you should follow a set of simple rules.

## Basic loader safety rules

To ensure the safety of the loader, the load, and the health of personnel, never operate a forklift unless you have completed a specific operator training course. You need to wear work clothes. The minimum set is reliable hard boots. It is preferable to have: a reflective vest, gloves, goggles and a helmet. When working in noisy environments, noise-canceling headphones are a must.

### Pre-shift inspection of the loader

1. Checking the integrity of the forks
2. Inspection of the loader carriage and mast for damage
3. Inspection of the high-pressure hose of the hydraulic system
4. Checking tire pressure and integrity
5. Checking fuel/oil/battery charge level
6. Checking the signal, headlights and beacons

Make sure the truck is in good condition and ready for the work shift. Only after that, you can get behind the wheel, and you need to do it right — according to the three-point contact rule.

### Getting started to work on the loader

1. Use the three-point climbing method: hold the handle on the frame with your left hand, hold the seat with your right hand, and hold your foot on the stand
2. Fasten the seat belt.
3. Look around before you move.

### Rules for driving a forklift

1. Keep the forks approximately 100 mm above the ground while driving.
2. Choose a safe speed (depending on location and cargo you move).
3. Do not stop suddenly.
4. Lift and lower the load slowly and carefully.
5. To ensure safe operation of the loader when reversing, turn halfway and look back — do not rely on mirrors.

### At the end of the shift

1. Park in specially designated areas on the facility territory.
2. Lower forks to the ground, place all controls in the neutral position and engage the parking brake.
3. Use the three-point exiting method. Just like entering a forklift, only in reverse.

### Forklift parking safety rules

1. Park in a designated area.
2. Lower forks to ground, put shifters to the neutral position.
3. Engage the parking brake.
4. Pull out the key.

### When working on a loader, it is prohibited to:

1. Start a shift on a broken truck.
2. Operate hydraulics from outside the cab.
3. Lifting a man with a pitchfork.
4. "Give a lift" to passengers.
5. Try to figure out the problem yourself if you do not have permission to do so.
6. Lift the forks with the load while moving.
7. Use a mobile phone while driving.
8. Violate other forklift safety requirements.
9. Block the fire exit when parking.
10. Leave the gear selector not in neutral and turn the engine off.
11. Leave the truck unattended and do not block it.

## Safety precautions when working on a loader with a load

Most accidents and emergencies happen during work with load. Therefore, treat your work with special attention. The operator is responsible not only for the integrity of the cargo and equipment, but also for the health of colleagues and his own safety.

### Basic rules for working with cargo

1. Set the forks as wide as the pallet allows.
2. Use a forklift with a capacity suitable for the weight of the load, or reduce the load.
3. Watch out for low doorways and other overhead obstacles.
4. When using attachments (clamp, rotator, etc.), you must have the appropriate qualifications.


### Safety rules when working with loads on inclines

1. Descend the ramp with a load in reverse only.
2. Lift the load along the ramp only in the forward.
3. If the load is blocking the view, ask for the help of an outside observer when driving the ramp.
4. Keep forks high enough not to hit the floor.

### When working with cargo is prohibited to:

1. Try to move a load that is larger than the capacity of the forklift
2. Move any unstable or not properly placed load
3. Travel with a load raised to a height of over 100 mm from the ground
4. Drive forward with a massive load blocking your view 
5. Try to turn when descending or ascending a ramp
6. Leave the forklift unattended on the ramp

### Safety rules if pedestrians work on the site

1. Follow the pedestrian's gaze to understand if he sees you.
2. If the pedestrian has not noticed you, slow down and honk at him.
3. Make sure pedestrians are at least one arm's length away from the forklift.
4. Educate and train pedestrians on the loading equipment principles and risks.

### It is forbidden to:

1. Allow passengers on the forklift
2. Allow to pass under the lifted load
3. Leave the forks at ground level when the forklift is unattended

Follow these simple rules to avoid emergencies, injuries and accidents.
