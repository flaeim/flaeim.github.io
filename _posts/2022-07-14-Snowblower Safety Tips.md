It is easier to clear snow from areas with a snowblower. But the misuse of it can pose major risks.

In this article, we will consider:

1. why snowblowers are dangerous;
2. the consequences of their misuse;
3. how to use them safely;
4. what the most common user’s mistakes are.

## Reasons why snowblowers are dangerous

The main danger is a rotating auger, which can not only hit you, but also wrap clothes around, and, eventually, a person’s leg or arm.

Because of the huge gain, high engine speeds with low torque turn into a relatively slow rotation of the auger, which has a high torque.

Self-propulsion is another danger.

If you leave a self-propelled snowblower running unattended, then when you turn on the gear, it will go in a straight line, whatever people and obstacles are in its way.

Even though the friction drive cannot provide the wheels with a lot of torque, the energy of the rotation of the wheels is quite enough to knock a child off their feet.

And given the working auger mechanism, a snowblower moving unattended is a mortal danger. After all, an auger with serrated metal blades can cut even a thick enough branch.

Most petrol machines weigh more than 30 kilograms, so improper loading or unloading leads to lower back injuries and other problems.

In addition, non-self-propelled and wheeled snowblowers are not very stable when clearing snow on slopes, so they often slide or tip over if they are not used correctly.

The voltage of 220 volts is a mortal danger to humans.

Therefore, electric snowblowers and petrol snow throwers with electric starting switches require very profound safety precautions.

Any mistake in connecting the snowblower to AC power can result in serious electrical shock, even death.

The extension cord you use must:

- be frost resistant,
- be flexible,
- not get wet,
- match the snow blower power.

The operator of an electric snow blower must carefully monitor the power cord. If the cable gets in the auger and breaks, it may cause:

- short circuit;
- electric shock.

Petrol snow blowers are no less dangerous. After all, 92 octane petrol, which most of such equipment is filled with, ignites from the slightest spark.

Carelessness while refueling the machine may cause:

- fire;
- explosion.

Another possible hazard is an ejected snow jet. If it gets into your eyes, it can seriously damage your eyesight. In addition, a snow jet can break thin window glass at close range.

## How to use a snowblower safely

Most of the rules that ensure the safe use of snowthrowers are set out in each unit’s user manual.

Therefore, before turning on the snowblower, you must carefully read the user manual. Up to the point where you can at any time, without hesitation, quote everything that relates to the safe use of the machine.

### Basic safety rules

All snow blower safety rules can be divided into the following categories:

1. general;
2. maintenance or repair;
3. pre-starting procedures;
4. snow removal.

#### General safety

These requirements mean a list of rules that, permanently or under certain conditions, can be applied to any other category.

The main one of these rules is the prohibition against any actions with the snowblower if you are:

- not feeling well;
- under the influence of alcohol, drugs and psychotropic substances;
- under the influence of medications that reduce attention or concentration.

Another general rule that applies to many situations is not to turn on an electric or petrol (diesel) engine during any manipulations with snow removal machines.

The engine must be switched off/shut down:

- when you move the unit to the place of work or the place of storage;
- during preventive maintenance;
- during scheduled maintenance;
- during repair.

Moreover, a shutdown motor means that it is not only turned off, in the sense of not working at the moment but also:

- unplugged from the extension cord (for electric snow blowers);
- with the spark plug wire removed (petrol units);
- with the wire removed from the fuel supply valve (diesel machines).

A very useful general rule is the following: if you want to do something with a snowblower (no matter what) — read the manual first.

This rule saves you from many problems.

After all, you can skip that rule only if you:

- know snow removal machines very well;
- have vast experience in their maintenance and repair.

An equally crucial rule applicable to various situations sounds like this: if you don’t know how to do this or that, don’t do it, but trust those who know and can. Or see how others work and only then do it yourself.

#### During maintenance or repair

Here are the basic rules that not only help to keep healthy but will also are the key to successful repair or maintenance of equipment:

Perform all work in a dry and insulated room with good lighting and ventilation.

Work only with dry and clean equipment. If it is necessary to service or repair a snowblower that has just removed snow, first clear it from snow, then dry it thoroughly.

Carry out all work on a clean and empty table to reduce the risk of losing parts.

If you change any parts, then use only the ones recommended by the snowblower's manufacturer.

Use only lubricants recommended by the manufacturer. If you do not have a user manual, download it on the Internet or search various forums for information on the most suitable lubricants.

#### Pre-starting procedures

Here are the basic rules that will make pre-starting procedures safe:

1. Refuel petrol or diesel machines in rooms protected from the wind with good exhaust ventilation. Refueling outdoors is allowed only in calm weather.
2. Connect the electric snow blower to the extension cord only at the worksite.
Start the engine of an electric or diesel snowblower at the place where you plan to start snow removal.
3. Do not refuel the electric or petrol snow blower immediately after turning off the engine. Let the muffler cool down a little.
4. Install (change) batteries only indoors to keep the connectors out of snow.
5. If you have not completed all the necessary scheduled maintenance work, do not start snow removal.

#### During snow removal
Here are the basic rules that will make working with snow blowers safe:

1. Dress in warm, loose-fitting clothing that does not interfere with movement. Wear warm and non-slip boots. Make sure you don't have anything loose (sleeves, laces, belt).
2. Be sure to wear safety glasses and earmuffs.
3. Wear leather or wool gloves — they will protect your hands from hypothermia and loss of sensitivity.
4. Never point the snow flow towards people, cars or windows.
5. If you are clearing snow on a slope, move up and down, otherwise, the snowblower may slip or tip over.
6. When operating an electric snowblower, keep a close eye on the cord. If the cord is wrapped around the auger or broken, do not try to unwind it. Disconnect the snowblower and take very small steps towards the house along the extension cord. Then unplug the extension cord, take the snowblower to a warm, dry room, clear it of snow, and only then clear the auger.
7. If a foreign object gets into the auger of the petrol snowblower, turn off the engine and remove the wire from the spark plug. Only then proceed to check the auger and assess the damage.
8. When you go to clear snow, ask someone to keep an eye on you. If something goes wrong, they can help you.


## Conclusions
The claim that safety regulations are written in blood is far from an exaggeration.
After all, if you neglect these rules, it often leads to:

1. accidents;
2. injuries.

Carefully follow the safety precautions you have read in this article, and you will protect yourself from:

1. injuries;
2. accidents;
3. damage to the snowblower.
