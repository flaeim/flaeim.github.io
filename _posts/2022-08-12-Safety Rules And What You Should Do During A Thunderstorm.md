Despite the beauty of nature, at times its acts can be fraught with risk and danger to humans. One such natural phenomenon that can cause irreparable harm is a thunderstorm. Often it occurs in the warm season, when people like to get out of town to relax, spending time near a water body or in the forest.

What the safety precautions during a thunderstorm are, how to protect yourself in this season, and what the consequences may be, we will consider in this article.

## A thunderstorm and lightning: what are they?

A thunderstorm is an atmospheric effect characterized by heavy precipitation, thunder, squall winds and lightning strikes.

### Signs of an approaching thunderstorm:

1. The cumulus clouds appear, a characteristic feature of which is a dark color and an oblong, elongated shape
2. A sharp drop in air temperature.
3. Stuffy and still air.
4. Clear audibility of distant sounds.
5. Approaching rumbles of thunder.

Lightning is one of the effects of a strong thunderstorm. This is an electrical atmospheric discharge that can cause a fire. Its voltage is up to 100 million V accompanied by a shock wave of sound (thunder) and a bright light flash of a bizarre shape. On average, its length is up to 2.5 km.

When lightning strikes a person, the internal organs are the first to suffer, especially those that contain air. A sharp muscle contraction under the influence of an electric current of such power can lead to bone fractures, including the spine. Stunning, disorientation, shock, paralysis and death — are all consequences for a person from a lightning strike.

According to statistics, about 70% of lightning victims are men. Knowing and following the basic safety rules during a thunderstorm can prevent many tragic accidents.

## In open area

If you find yourself in an area where there is absolutely nowhere to hide from an impending thunderstorm (plain, field), then the first thing to do is to determine how far the lightning is from you. To do this, you should note the time that passes between the flash and the heard thunder. If the time was 3 seconds, then the distance is 1000 m, 2 seconds - 600 m, but 1 second says that a natural electrical source is only 300 meters away from you.

## Your safety during a thunderstorm will depend on the correct actions. 

The main and most common mistakes are the following:

- Attempt to take cover under a lonely tall tree or haystack.
- Run, walk or stand upright.
- Seek and climb any hill.

To wait out a thunderstorm in an open area, you should find some kind of lowland (pit, ravine) or just squat down, but not lie down on the ground. The distance from tall lonely objects should be at least 200 m. Remember that usually, a lightning strike selects the highest objects, and you, once in an open area, will be one of them. Do not approach water bodies and do not use the phone — it is better to turn it off.

## In forest

In wooded areas, it is safest to find shelter under small shrubs. If there are no small bushes nearby, then there should be a distance of at least 4-5 m between the trees and you. You need to sit down, taking the fetal position.

You should know that if a tree is strong and mighty, then this does not mean at all that it can withstand a lightning strike and provide you with reliable shelter. According to statistics, most often the "victims" of thunderstorms are oaks, spruces and poplars; lightning is one of the causes of fires in the forest.

_Do not build a fire until the thunderstorm stops completely, because fire is capable of attracting electrical discharges._

If you are on a hiking trip, it is recommended to quickly set up tents and, having changed into dry clothes, stay there. Metal objects (dishes, axes, etc.) must be carried a few meters from the camp. 

## By a pond or lake

Water is an excellent electricity conductor, therefore, during a thunderstorm, you should immediately leave the water body and move away from it to a safe distance (at least 100 m). You should not wait for the thunderstorm out on the shore in a tent or hiding under the trees, because there are the most elevated objects on the coast.

If a natural phenomenon caught you in a boat, and it is too far to sail to the shore, follow the following rules: 

1. Wet clothing is also capable of attracting lightning, as is the surface of the water, so sit on any dry clothes. A life jacket also will do.
2. Cover yourself with an awning or cellophane, but it absolutely can not touch the water.

In addition to water and wet clothes, the following things can attract lightning: a working mobile phone, an umbrella (especially ribs and a central pole), or any metal items (keys, tools).

## In a car

If a thunderstorm catches you in a car, do not leave it. Many people mistakenly believe that it is dangerous to wait out a thunderstorm while sitting in a car. In fact, the vehicle protects the people inside quite well, since even with a lightning strike, the discharge goes through the surface of the metal. Therefore, if a thunderstorm caught you in the car, turn off the engine, close all the windows, lower the car antenna and wait until the bad weather blows over. However, do not touch door handles or other metal parts.

## Indoors

As a rule, thanks to lightning rods, the room is the safest place to wait out a thunderstorm. But, there is a possibility to encounter ball lightning, which can often enter any premises through open vents, windows and doors. So, in case you are waiting out a natural phenomenon at home:

- Prevent any drafts by closing all windows and doors. Don't forget about the chimney.
- Do not use a telephone, including a landline. The same applies to a fireplace or stove. Chimney smoke can attract thunderstorms.
- Turn off all electrical appliances and stay away from electrical wiring, sockets or the panel.
- Stay away from windows.
- Take off your jewelry

## Encounter with ball lightning
Safety during a thunderstorm and an encounter with lightning in the form of a ball depends on how much you are able to control your emotions and actions. The main thing you should remember is that such lightning appears for a maximum of 2 minutes. This time, try not to make any movements because the ball follows the air currents. By running, you will only make it "chase" you. If possible, stay away from any electrical appliances.

If ball lightning is moving in your direction, then by no means should you throw objects at it in an attempt to change direction. Upon collision with any object or surface, ball lightning will simply explode, which can also lead to disastrous consequences. The best option would be to slowly, without sudden movements, move away from its pathway (only if it is still far away from you). Watch your breathing, it should be slow and shallow. When the ball approaches, be sure to freeze. Moving in the air current, it will simply fly off to the side past you.

## In strong wind

Thunderstorms are often accompanied by strong gusts of wind. With such adverse events, there are also several recommendations:

- In strong winds, avoid being near power lines, trees, and billboards.
- When the weather is getting worse, do not let children go outside, do not leave them alone.
- Drive carefully and cautiously. Drivers must follow the road rules and the speed limit.
- It is better to park cars away from tall trees, lampposts and power lines.
- In case of strong wind, it is necessary to remove things from roofs, balconies, porches and window sills, which, if falling, can cause injury to people.
- When leaving home, close windows and balcony doors, and turn off electrical appliances.

Following these simple rules, you will survive the storm without consequences and will be able to continue enjoying outdoor recreation.
