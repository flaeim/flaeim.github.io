Acids are the most known corrosive elements, they can cause damages to your skin, your clothes and your eyes in case they splash on them. Thus the individuals working in acidic places and environments should ensure that they are safe by wearing safety and personal protective equipment. The ppe prevents your skin from getting contaminated from acids and other mutagens.

PPE for working with acid includes safety footwear, face and eye protective equipment, skin protection, body protection as well as respiratory protection. Below we are going to discuss these:

## 1.Protective clothing and footwear for working with acids

When working with acid ensure that you wear protective clothing and footwear. Putting on gloves and lab coats or overalls reduce the exposure of the body to acid. Do not try to wear open shoes or sandals when working in such conditions, you are required to put on boots that are well closed. The gloves worn should be made from rubber as well as the boots if not leather. 

When choosing the PPE for working that is meant to prevent you from skin exposure and burns ensure that you consider the type of material which has been used on the particular equipment.

## 2.Eye and face protection equipment

Ensure that you put on safety eyeglasses to prevent acid substances from splashing into your eyes. Always make sure that the eyeglasses you put on fit well on your face that they cannot fall off easily. They should be equipped with the venting for preventing splash from the inside, this feature provides full protection against splashes that may occur when working with acids.

Acids are in liquid form thus they can easily splash to the eyes or the face thus causing damages and blisters on the face and they can even cause blindness when splashes to the eyes. It is also advisable to put on nose masks that prevent you from choking because acids are known to have a very strong choking smell. 

## 3.Respiratory protection

Respiratory protection is mostly considered when handling fuming acids. Non-fuming gas do not need respiratory protection. In case you are working with a fuming acid ensure that the environment is well supplied with sufficient air.

## Handling Acids

Different types of acids require different ways of handling. Some acids are not very corrosives, for example, the organic acids such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and acetic acid are not corrosive whereas the inorganic acids such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid are known to be very corrosive when they land on a person's skin. Thus you need to take different styles and considerations when handling these acids.

When working with acids you should be very cautious about how you store the acid and on the containers, you store acids in. ensure that you label containers properly before storing to avoid unnecessary mistakes. Some acids are known to react vigorous with water producing flames and others react gently. To avoid confusion ensure that you label the acids to avoid causing unnecessary burns.

Safety is the key factor to ensure that lives are saved and no unnecessary accidents happening. What you wear and how you handle things determines how safe you are. Environments you work in will enable you to choose what to use for proper safety. Acids are all in liquid and thus they can flow easily and also splash. Stay safe by putting on the personal protective equipment when at work.
