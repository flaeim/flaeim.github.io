Proper maintenance of the forklift battery is a must to extend its life and performance. However, do not forget about safety rules. Observing them you can preserve the health of workers, and avoid damage to equipment and property. The tips below apply to lead-acid batteries.

## 1. Do not smoke, produce open-flame ignition sources or sparks, or perform welding work in the immediate vicinity of the rechargeable traction battery.

During the charging process, light and combustible hydrogen gas is released, which, when mixed with oxygen, forms an explosive detonating gas â€” open flames or sparks can cause a fire or explosion.

## 2. The battery cover must be open during charging and closed during use.

Good ventilation is necessary to dissipate the hydrogen produced by the battery, otherwise, it will accumulate to a dangerous concentration. Opening the battery will allow the gas to escape.

## 3. Do not remove vent caps.

Ventilation caps are provided with ventilation holes with a diameter of 1-2 mm through which the gas escapes. If the caps are opened or removed, drops of electrolyte will fall on the top of the traction battery, which can lead to a short circuit in the battery case or frame. This will end up with your forklift problems.


## 4. Always turn off the charger before disconnecting the battery.

This must be done because an energized charger can produce sparks and start a fire.

## 5. Never drag the cord to disconnect the battery. Do hold on to the power plug.

If you drag the cord, eventually you will damage it. Damaged cords are dangerous due to the risk of an electric arc. They may cause electrical injury or fire.

## 6. Always fully charge the forklift lead-acid battery.

Disconnecting the battery before it is fully charged with a standard charger can degrade battery performance and shorten battery life.

## 7. Keep the battery surface dry and clean.

A wet and dirty battery surface can be a reason for an electric shock when it connects to a charger. In addition, due to dirt and moisture, it can self-discharge, which can lead to deep discharge if the battery is not used for a long time.

## 8. Except in an emergency, do not let it discharge below 20%-level.

The lead-acid traction battery is designed for 1000-1500 cycles with a depth of discharge up to 80% of the nominal capacity. With a deeper discharge, the expected life is significantly reduced. For example, instead of 5 years (one shift, 5 days a week), the battery will only last 2 years.

Besides, deep discharge causes problems in the forklift's electrical system: overheating of electrical circuits, blown fuses, and so on. Sometimes the charger will even stop detecting the battery, and you will need an expensive repair.

## 9. Provide time for the batteries to cool down, and also make the cooling process available.

During charging, the battery temperature rises, causing it to overheat and shorten its life. You can set fans for better cooling in the charging area.

## 10. Check the battery case, cables and plugs for damage on a regular basis.
Every time before you charge, check the battery and charging equipment to make sure they are in proper condition. Damaged equipment can cause failures and emergencies.

## 11. If the charger is not equipped with an automatic equalization mode, be sure to do this procedure yourself at least once a month.

The forklift traction battery consists of 2V cells. They are connected to produce an output voltage of 24V, 36V, 48V or higher. Each cell is to some extent individual, so they are charged and discharged at a different rate. After some time, the voltage of cells begins to differ from the nominal value.

If you do not correct it with an equalizing charge, the battery will not last long. Refer to the operation and maintenance manual for the procedure details.

## 12. Checking the electrolyte level and topping up with distilled water is performed only after a full charge.

During discharge, the electrolyte level drops, and during charging, it rises. Therefore, if you add liquid before the full charge level, then during the next charge, the electrolyte may spill.
